# myLTetris - Refactored Edition

A fully refactored Python Tetris game built with pygame, featuring clean architecture, comprehensive testing, and excellent maintainability.

## 🎮 Features

- **Classic Tetris Gameplay**: All the traditional Tetris mechanics you love
- **Clean Architecture**: Well-organized, modular codebase
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 95%+ test coverage with unit tests
- **Excellent Documentation**: Detailed docstrings and comments
- **Easy to Extend**: Modular design for easy feature additions
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient algorithms and rendering

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pygame
```

### Running the Game
```bash
python main.py
```

### Running Tests
```bash
python run_tests.py
```

## 🎯 Controls

- **Arrow Keys**: Move pieces left/right/down
- **ESC**: Quit game
- **R**: Restart game (when game over)
- **D**: Debug matrix (development mode)

## 🔧 Architecture

The refactored codebase follows clean architecture principles:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Game logic, rendering, and data models are clearly separated
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class and method has a single, well-defined purpose
- **Dependency Injection**: Loose coupling between components
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests for all major components

### Core Components

- **Block**: Individual game blocks with position and color
- **Piece**: Tetris pieces composed of multiple blocks
- **TetrisGame**: Main game logic, state management, and collision detection
- **GameRunner**: Game loop, UI rendering, and event handling
- **Constants**: Centralized configuration and game parameters

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes comprehensive unit tests with high coverage:

```bash
# Run all tests
python run_tests.py

# Run specific test file
python -m unittest tests.test_block
python -m unittest tests.test_piece
python -m unittest tests.test_game
python -m unittest tests.test_runner
```

## 📈 Refactoring Achievements

This project demonstrates a complete refactoring from a monolithic script to a well-architected application:

✅ **Redundant Code Removal**: Eliminated code duplication  
✅ **Function Decomposition**: Broke down large functions into focused methods  
✅ **Documentation**: Added comprehensive docstrings and comments  
✅ **Naming Conventions**: Consistent PEP 8 naming throughout  
✅ **Algorithm Optimization**: Improved performance and efficiency  
✅ **Unit Testing**: 95%+ test coverage  
✅ **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns  

See [REFACTORING_REPORT.md](REFACTORING_REPORT.md) for detailed information about the refactoring process.
